## Introduction

This is a guide about how to create a simple e-commerce using Next.js, AWS S3, MySQL, NextAuth.js, MySQL, email verification, React and Stripe gateway. This guide is 100% educational, for example auxiliary functions are in the same file where are used for better understanding (in real projects you put all your axuliary functions in the same folder/file) or use another approach to validate API calls. This e-commerce is supposed to be a simple Business-to-Consumer (B2C). Once completed, I will share a MySQL dump and provide guidance on the structure of the 'credentials.ts' file.
